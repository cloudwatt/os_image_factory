# The following packages should be upgraded to the latest version in the archive,
# even if the version indicates this is a downgrade, because the version numbering
# is messed up.  I got this list by pinning all remote package versions
# (Pin: origin ?*) at 1001 and running "apt-get upgrade" to see what was listed
# on a test machine.
#
# A similar but more selective approach should be applied to just these
# packages.
