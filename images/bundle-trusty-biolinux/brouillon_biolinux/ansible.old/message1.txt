=== Installing Bio-Linux 8 ===

This script will install Bio-Linux 8 onto your machine.  Please read these
notes carefully before you proceed.

* The process may take several hours.  You will not be able to use your machine
  during the upgrade and you should not try to power it off.

* You should back up all your data.  There is always a slim chance that
  a big upgrade like this will render your machine unbootable and that it will
  need to be installed from scratch if the recovery DVD can't fix it.

* Have a working Bio-Linux 8 DVD or USB stick to hand just in case, as
  this can help you to recover if problems occur (as noted above).

* This script is designed to be idempotent, in other words you can run it
  several times in a row and once the upgrade is done it will not change
  anything.  If your machine has been partially updated you can and should run
  this script again and again until the process is fully completed and the
  script declares that it has finished.

* If you have installed packages from an external PPA you may get an error
  saying the upgrade cannot be calculated.  In particular the Cinnamon desktop
  causes this.  You will need to remove the packages and put them back after
  the upgrade.

=== What the installer will do ===

2 - Ensure that your base system is upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04.
2a- ** reboot, prompting you to run the script again **
3 - Configure APT to see all Bio-Linux software repositories.
